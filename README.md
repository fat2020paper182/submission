# Supplemental Material for Fair Near Neighbor Search: Independent Range Sampling in High Dimensions

## Requirements

Python 3, pandas, seaborn. 

Recommended: PyPy3 (experiments run around 30 times faster)

## Reproducing experiments

Run `bash exp.sh` to obtain all files used in the evaluation logbook `log.ipynb`.

## Reproducing plots

All plots in the paper are copied from the Jupyter notebook present
in `log.ipynb`. Install Jupyter notebook, run the experiments from above, 
and run all cells in the Jupyter notebook to reproduce the plots.

## Raw results

Instead of running the experiments, one can also reproduce the plots 
from the raw experimental data. To do this,  
unzip `raw_results.zip` present in the top directory and run the 
Jupyter notebook.
